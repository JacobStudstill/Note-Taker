# Note Taker

## Motivation

My motivation for this project was to create an application that will allow a user to view, add, and delete notes. This can be used for users to keep up with tasks they are working on, still plan on completing, and deleting when they are finished.
## Demonstration




## Languages

The frameworks used for this were HTML, CSS, Node.JS, and Javascript

## Usage

Add a title for your note and enter text. Click on the save button to add it to the list on the left side. Click the trashcan icon to delete notes. Click on the note title in the list to show note fully on the right side
